### Statement 

[Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/2002/problem/E)

### Solution

If all $b_i$s are distinct, then the answer would just be the maximum value of $a_i$, as that would be the last block standing. If $b_i = b_{i+1}$, then the time it takes for both blocks to merge is $a_i + a_{i+1}$. If $b_i = b_j$ but they aren't next to each other, then the right block would keep getting worn down until everything in between is gone, then it can merge with the left block.

Maintain a stack. When adding an element to the stack, check if it can outlast the top element in the stack. If it can, remove the top element. If it has the same $b$ value as the top element, then add their $a$ values. While you are removing elements, keep track of the longest block that takes to wear down, let that be $m$, and when you merge $a$ values, the merge is $a_i + a_j - m$. If you don't merge, keep the current value of $a$ you have and push it into the stack.

Now, the first element of the stack should take the longest to wear down, and that is your answer for each update.
