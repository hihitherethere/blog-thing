### Statement

### Solution

Alice always wants to go toward the root, and Queen always wants to pull Alice toward the nearest leaf. Then, the answer is the probability you go up instead of going all the way down to the nearest leaf.

Consider a bamboo of length $n$, and bashing out small values of $n$ makes it obvious that the probability of getting to the top in the $i$th node from the top is $\frac{i-1}{n-1}$. Then, the answer for each node is just the probability of getting to the top if the bamboo consist of its parent and its closest leaf, then multiplied with the probability of escaping from the parent node.
